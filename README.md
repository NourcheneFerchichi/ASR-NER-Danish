# ASR-NER-Danish

It's a small case study, which can be formulated quite easily: Extract as much information as possible out of some speech samples from Danish radio.

For data, we use a zip file with 55 audio files of 1 minute duration. For the 10 first, there's ground truth Danish transcripts, maybe just to get a head start with the NLP part (see next paragraph).

So, a solution is desired, where you extract transcripts (they will of course be non-perfect). From the generated text, extract as much as you can using NLP, e.g. (named) entities, numbers, etc.
